Simply monopolises him the <em>whole</em> time."</p><p>"Oh, they were just sitting out one dance," said the man with her, displaying an unexpected acuteness. "Never mind looking at me that way, Miss Kitty. I know whom you were talking about. J. B. just didn't want to dance it, I guess."</p><p>"No wonder.
