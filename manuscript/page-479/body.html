<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Bob was the Chorus. He was no actor; but the part only required someone with a voice, and he had a really beautiful high sweet tenor. All he must do was to appear in season and out of season and jodel, which he did to admiration, with a perfectly grave face, for as I have said, he was of a sober disposition, and to tell the truth saw nothing comic in it. But about the seventh or eighth jodel the audience fell into paroxysms of laughter and so continued whenever the Chorus came on. Bob made one of the hits of the evening, to his own great confusion and the frank surprise of everyone else in the cast.</p><p>"Bob? Oh, all right. But that's one of the things they're laughing at; isn't that funny?"</p><p>"Why not, if he's funny?" said Muriel, puzzled.</p><p>"Oh, I don't mean funny <em>that</em> way, you know, I mean  <em>funny</em>. Why don't you come and look on a while, Maze? Bob'll do better if you're there."</p></div> </div>
