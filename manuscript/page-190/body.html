Now if you'll just correct one report: Mrs. Pallinder's necklace did <em>not</em> cost five thousand dollars. It cost—ah—well, gentlemen, it was a present to my wife  on our last wedding anniversary, and to let the cat out of the bag, it was bought with the surplus of a little flyer in Phosphate I took—now I beg you won't say anything about that in the papers—you might say, with entire truth, that it did <em>not</em> cost five thousand dollars. The necklace and earrings together came to more than that, and I believe I bought her some other trinket at the time, a brooch or something—but the whole business was not more than eight or nine thousand, and no one item was quite as much as five. Now if you'll just revise that statement, I'd be obliged. Sam, bring the whisky."</p></div> </div>
